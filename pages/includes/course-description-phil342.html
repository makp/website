<h3>PHIL 342: What Makes Us Moral?</h3>
<p>
  This course will discuss the issue of whether human morality has an
  evolutionary basis. More specifically, this class will examine
  different theories that rely on Darwin's theory of natural selection
  to explain the evolution of cooperation, and what these theories imply
  about the evolution of moral behavior.
