<h3>PHIL 460: The Evolution of Complexity</h3>
<!-- <p>
     This course will discuss the issue of whether human morality has an
     evolutionary basis. More specifically, this class will examine
     different theories that rely on Darwin's theory of natural selection
     to explain the evolution of cooperation, and what these theories imply
     about the evolution of moral behavior.
